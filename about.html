    <h1>about</h1>
    FOODIEFEED RESIPIES is a project run by the people at VertiStudio. The company<br> was founded in 2012 and the team has since grown to 20+ people spread 
    around the world.<br> FOODIEFEED RESIPIES
     was developed in 2018 during a 3-day hackathon.<br> Soon, we got fond of our pet project and 3 months later we 
    launched the MVP on ProductHunt.<br> We got a good feedback from the community that voted it üèÜ ‚ÄúProduct of the day‚Äù.<br>
We continued to bring new features to the AI search engine launching the business name<br> generator and
 brand name generator tools.
Next, in 2022 we launched the DomainWheel blog. <br>Every week, we publish new tutorials, and guides that teach you how to build your brand,
<br>start a business in your ideal niche, pick a host for your website, and  of course hit the ground<br> running with an optimized name.
